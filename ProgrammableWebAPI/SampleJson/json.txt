'summary':'Google API solution gets putperformed by Mapping specialist<br />\n<br />\nI am a web developer and had a 2 month project testing both solutions after reading the outcome of the IMFA regarding European business mapping providers.<br />\n<br />\nI noted that the free Google solution took twice as long to develop, had only basic Geocoding and everything else had to be developed from scratch I.e. criteria search, database management. Still Google business customers both paid (up to ?7800) a year  and free (if the solution will not be re sold (i.e. vehichle tracking) have no access to the UK postcode data from the royal mail as Google are no licensed (hence the often appalling accuracy) with only 4 digit postcode verification. <br />\n<br />\nThe directions are somewhat limited for business users / developers and do not include petrol costs as would be great for working out expense claims etc.<br />\n<br />\nIn a positive, Google is a pretty basic platform and for the most part is free to use and widely available and recognised.<br />\n<br />\nThe API platform from ViaMichelin (used a mixture of javascript skills) was offered to me on a free trial for 45 days and took only a few weeks to complete, Geocoding for address verification was included (so ideal for store finder, reserve and collect, etc and gave me access to live human support (to see what else I could do with their api). They provided me a platform with full Europe coverage and geocoded Ireland which Google could not offer for a price cheaper than the Google enterprise and premier.<br />\n<br />\nBing fell behind when it came to customer support as it was non existent and the former multimap owned company owned by microsoft took just over the 2 months to get back to me.<br />\n<br />\nLike for like, The new ViaMichelin API solution wins, For a basic solution use Google, for business&#039;s looking for real quality use Viamichelin<br />\n',
